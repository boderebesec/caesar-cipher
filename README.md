# Caesar Cipher Implementation

# Caesar Cipher

A PHP implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption algorithm, demonstrating basic cryptography concepts and file handling.

## Description

This project implements the classic Caesar cipher encryption method in PHP. It provides both encryption and decryption capabilities while demonstrating file handling and basic cryptographic concepts.

## Features

- • Text encryption using Caesar cipher shift technique
- • Text decryption capabilities
- • File input/output handling
- • Command line interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure PHP is installed on your system
3. Navigate to the project directory

## Usage

```bash
# Place your text in input.txt
# Run the encryption script
php main_caesarcipher.php

# Check output directory for results
```

## Project Structure

```
